## How to debug in case of crash or bugs

Build with `-s build_type=Debug`

You can manually run some `app_name` under `gdb` debugger https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/

```bash
gdb -ex "r" -ex "bt" --args app_name .........
```

## How to increase log level

Add command-line arguments:

```bash
--vmodule=*main*=100,*=200 --enable-logging=stderr --log-level=100
```

see https://www.chromium.org/for-testers/enable-logging

## How to capture trace report

Add command-line arguments:

```bash
--start_tracing --tracing_categories=*,disabled-by-default-memory-infra
```

After app close event trace report will be saved into json file.

You can view saved trace report in `chrome://tracing/`
